# Now, finally we are at our Controller layer, and as you can see we are using Dependency Injection, which is extremely popular in FastAPI. 
# You see our endpoints depend on get_user_service and assigns whatever this function returns (Spoiler, itâ€™s a UserService instance) to the user_servicevariable.
